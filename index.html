		<h2><i><b>&ldquo;The Only Easy Day was Yesterday&hellip;&rdquo;</b></i>-My personal interpertation of Hell Week</h2>
		<img src="hellweek.jpg" alt="hellweek">
		<p>You lie on your back, thankful to have caught a rest. All the muscles in your back and legs feel like they're on fire.
		Everything else however, is ice cold. You gulp in deep breaths of air, like it was your only food and you're been hungry for months. You look to your side, your other SEALs in training stumble up to you, with the drill instructors trailing close behind.
		Hell week has been going on for just about two days, and you're already feeling the toll. Each and every day you are pushed to your absolute limits, even a few seconds of rest seem like heavem.
		But that enjoyment, however is short lived.
		</p>
		<p> Drill Instructor Marc Hadfield, or Instructor H is right up in your face again. "CHENKO! What did I just say?" You pause, sifting through memories of the past few days trying to find out what the actual heck your drill instructor had ordered you to do.
		"I don't recall sir", you mumble. "DROP!", he orders the class. You hear what sounds like a stampede of wild elephants as all 55 students of BUDS class 253 get on all fours and into plank position. 
		"Anderson!", "Hooyah Instructor H!" a voice calls out, "Was he right?". "Hooyah Instructor H!", "Is that Hooyah yes or Hooyah no?". "Hooyah yes Instructor H!"
		"Well you are goddamn wrong!" Instructor H hollers back, "I clearly said to drop and give me twenty after your 4 mile run, not enjoy a beauty sleep!"
		"So clearly Wasdin, you don't belong here.", "You can't even handle a little run in the sand! You'll never be a SEAL, you worthless excuse of a soldier! You've got every opportunity to get off this beach.I suggest you take them! Go on, ring that bell! There's donuts and coffee waiting for you!"</p>
		<p>You hesitate, the offer sounds really good, you haven't eaten anything except for cold MREs with sand up your ass ever since Hell Week started, and crawling into a warm bed after a hot shower sounds much better than freezing like an icicle lying down naked on a metal pier in -35 degree water.
		But that's not what you came here to do. 
		</p>
		<p>You're here to become a Navy SEAL, the US's most advanced and renowned special forces unit. Established during World War Two, the faceless men have served their country for almost a century, carrying out nightime clandestine opperations anywhere from
		the jungles of Vietnam, to the city streets of Iraq. Know for their grueling admission processes, the journey to become apart of this elite unit of warriors is long and treacherous. Many never make it. Only the few with the mental aptitude capable of conquering even the most difficult of tasks can succeed here.
		And you're going to be one of them.
